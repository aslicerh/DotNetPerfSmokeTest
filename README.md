Run compare_containers.py. It will print out diffs in the timings between the containers defined in it. If any timing falls outside of the given threshold, it returns a non-zero exit code.

TODO: Have a script to build a container with a given RPM and compare it to the current published RPM.

TODO: Add a section on how to add more tests.
